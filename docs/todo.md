# The app TODO list

## Interface

- [ ] add a separator between the input and output frames so it makes possible to change the input widget size without changing the window size
- [ ] Read available languages from Genimi API and use them to fill the language combo boxes

## Settings

- [ ] Read available model names from Genimi API and use a current flash light model
