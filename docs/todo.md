# The app TODO list

## Interface

- [ ] add a separator between the input and output frames so it makes possible to change the input widget size without changing the window size
- [ ] Read available languages from Genimi API and use them to fill the language combo boxes

## System tray

- [ ] Handle double-click (pystray doesn't have a direct double-click event, but we can simulate it or rely on the menu for show/hide)

## Settings

- [ ] Read available model names from Genimi API and use a current flash light model
