## üîê API Key Safety & Best Practices

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Notice**: Your API key is like a password - keep it secure!

### Key Safety Recommendations

1. **One Key Per Purpose**: Create separate API keys for different applications
   - Use one key specifically for Lexi
   - Don't reuse keys across different projects

2. **Never Share Your Key**:
   - Don't post it on GitHub, forums, or social media
   - Don't include it in screenshots or code snippets
   - Don't share it with others, even friends

3. **Secure Storage**:
   - Store it in your [`config/settings.json`](config/settings.json:1) file
   - Add `config/settings.json` to your [`.gitignore`](.gitignore:1) to prevent accidental commits
   - Never hardcode it directly in source files

4. **Monitor Usage**: Regularly check your usage in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com) to detect any unauthorized use

5. **Rotate Keys**: If you suspect your key has been compromised, generate a new one immediately and update your configuration
