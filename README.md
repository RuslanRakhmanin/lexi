# Lexi: Your Instant, LLM-Powered Text Assistant

The Lexi Project is a lightweight, responsive desktop utility designed to seamlessly integrate advanced text processing into your daily workflow. Leveraging the power of LLM (the Google Gemini API is available at the moment), Lexi provides instant translation, proofreading, and custom text manipulation, all accessible via a convenient global hotkey.
